# Lox

Lox is a programming language designed by Robert Nystrom for his book
titled [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).
I'd like to express my gratitude to Nystrom for his wonderful work.

This repository contains code that I typed down when reading Nystrom's book.
It contains two parts:
 * jlox: a Lox interpreter written in Java
 * clox: a Lox interpreter written in C

Most of the lines of code are directly from the book, while others are my own
solutions to some of the challenges in the book. Comments are either sentences
from the text of the book or my personal understanding of the content.
